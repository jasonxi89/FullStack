# FullStack

All the Projects are implemented with React/Redux + Node.JS + MongoDB.

For MongoDB, I used https://www.mongodb.com/ as online server.

For other media datas, such as avatars, i used https://www.cloudinary.com/

If you want to check it, please install all the dependencies on the package.json.

Also, because i used Redux Devtools for debug, you also need to use npm to install it: npm install --save-dev redux-devtools-extension

Project 1 and Project 2 are similar, it is a management system. But Project 2 has more features.

Project 3 is item displayed system. I am working on making it more fancy.
